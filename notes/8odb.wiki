- a tool to organize code by site and person
  - person == yourself too

- so if your github username is johndoe and you're working on my-cool-project
  you can get it on your computer with:

$ ghq get https://github.com/johndoe/my-cool-project

- ghq would put this in the 

~/code/github.com/johndoe/my-cool-project directory
